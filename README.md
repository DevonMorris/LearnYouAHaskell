# Learn You a Haskell for Great Good
[Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) is an online guide to learning the Haskell programming language and learning about functional programming. Here are my efforts and insights from following this book.

My implementation is done in [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) with the [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) kernel. You should be able to view and run my code by clicking the binder badge at the top of this readme.
